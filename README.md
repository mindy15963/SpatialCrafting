# SpatialCrafting
The code base of best mod.

## Getting Started

The first thing you wanna do is get 4 <b>Wood-carved Crafters</b>. Place 4 of them in a 2x2 grid, and the 2x2 crafter will appear.
In order to make bigger recipes, you will need the next levels of crafters - look up "crafter" in JEI!

## Crafting Items

To craft items, insert the required items for the spatial recipe in the holograms by right clicking on them. You can take items out by either right clicking with an open hand, or left clicking.  
For this step JEI is highly recommended! Simply look up the recipe (for the bigger crafters, for example) in JEI. When near a crafter, you can <b>press "start crafting help" to automaticly configure to holograms to allow for easy inserations</b> for that recipe.  
JEI shows each layer of the recipe individually (from bottom to top - layer 1 will be the lowest layer and so on). <b>Use the buttons near the recipe to traverse the layers of the recipe</b>. This will also configure the nearest crafter to activate the relevent layer.

## Adding Recipes

You may have noticed there are not that many spatial recipes. This is because Spatial Crafting is designed to provide custom recipes to various modded items. For this reason adding recipes is extremely easy:  
First, insert a nearby crafter with the items that you want to serve as the input. (Tip: <b>type /sc layer <layerNumber> to activate the layer that you want to insert items into.)</b>  
Then, hold the item (or any amount of that item) that you want to be the output for the recipe in your main hand.  
Finally, <b>type /sc addRecipe (or /sc ar) to add the recipe</b>.  
<i>Note: the recipe will be added immediately, but currently (fix coming soonTM) you will need to close and reopen the game to see the changes in JEI.
